## Definitions

### Source Code

The human readable version of software. The code is written by developers and can be read and modified by others. The code can be compiled into an executable or binary, that is not readable.

### Open Source Hardware

Open source hardware products are tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things — whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, distribute, and use those things.

### Intellectual property

Intellectual property (or "IP") is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses copyrights, patents, and trademarks. It also includes other types of rights, such as trade secrets, publicity rights, moral rights, and rights against unfair competition.

### Software Licence

A software license is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software. A typical software license grants the licensee, typically an end-user, permission to use one or more copies of software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner's exclusive rights under copyright law. Two common categories for software under copyright law, are proprietary software and open source software.

### Copyright

Copyright is a form of intellectual property, applicable to certain forms of creative work. Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution.

### Copyleft

Copyleft is a copyright licensing scheme in which an author surrenders some, but not all, rights under copyright law. Copyleft allows an author to impose some restrictions on those who want to engage in activities that would usually be reserved by the copyright holder. Under copyleft, derived works may be produced if they are released under the compatible copyleft scheme.

### Version control system

A software product or service that is designed to store and retrieve several versions of source code and related assets in a consistent way, and that can be centralized, decentralized or distributed.
