## Next Steps

### Open Standards

- **Endorsement of current open Standards identified in the GC standard on Web interoperability and GC standard on Web accessibility**
  - HTML5, UTF-8, RDFa Lite, Schema.org, Atom
  - WCAG 2.0

- **Require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions) store and manage data with open Standards**
  - Factor in the use of open Standards when calculating total cost of ownership (TCO) of a solutions including exit or transition costs
  - Configure existing solutions to use open standards where possible
  - EARB process to support active application when adopting solutions

- **Endorsement of current preferred (pilots, principles, guidelines) open Standards in the GC**
  - Open Contracting Data Standard (PSPC Open Contracting Data Standard pilot)
  - PDF/A, EPUB3, XML, CSV (GC open data/information principles)
  - EPUB3, PDF/A, ODF, EML, MBOX, .. (LAC guidelines on file formats for transferring information resources of enduring value)

- **Align with UK open standards for government**
  - Adopt open Standards selected by UK Open Standards Board
    - HTML5, PDF/A, ODF, Open Contracting Data Standard, vCard, iCalendar, ..
  - Collaborate with UK to select new open standards for governments
  - Adapt and adopt UK guidance on ODF and procurement to GC

### Open Source Software use

- **Plan to eliminate current lock-in to closed-source operating system by favoring use of open source multi-platform or Web applications**
  - Endorse open source Web browser, office suite and other productivity tools for use by all departments and agencies' workplace technology devices

- **Require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions) actively and fairly consider open source software (OSS) during procurement**
  - Factor in the use of OSS when calculating TCO of a solutions including exit or transition costs
  - Select OSS on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility, when there is no significant overall (full-lifecycle) cost (TCO) difference with closed-source solutions
  - EARB process to support active application when adopting solutions

- **Use OSS components in development projects and build solutions based on existing OSS**

### Open Source Software contribution

- **Support and be an active contributor (code, issues, testing, roadmap, ..) to OSS used by the GC and/or where there is benefit to Canadians**
  - Comply to the licenses of OSS projects they contribute to

- **Support initiatives such as the The Linux Foundation's [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) to help ensure that critical libraries for modern Internet communications are monitored and supported**

### Release code developed internally as under Open Source Software licenses

- **Publish as OSS all source code created or modified, whether developed in-house by government staff or through negotiated contracts**

- **Encourages contributions to its OSS projects, whether it be code, commentary, bug reports, feature requests, or overall strategic direction**

### Open Source Software Community Building

- **Provide awards and recognition for departments, units and individuals using open standards and open source software in the GC**

### Other

- **Update cloud adoption strategy to reflect direction on the use of open standards and OSS**
