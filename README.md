# Open First Whitepaper (DRAFT)

This whitepaper captures our efforts to make the Government of Canada processes and services more transparent and accessible to our citizens with open standards, open source software, open government (code), open procurement and open culture.

This whitepaper is being co-developed by many members of the GC open source community in an effort to get the full-picture of open in the GC. Once we can better understand our use of open tools, programs and activities, we can find new ways to work, build and provide services. While we have made a first attempt at gathering information, including best practices and jurisdictional case studies, there is still a lot more that can be contributed in order to make this document complete. If you have something to add, we would encourage you to contribute your thoughts, expertise and references. 

We want to learn as much as possible from Canadians, our partners, academics and technical experts to help us update GC policies, governance, funding and processes with an open lens
