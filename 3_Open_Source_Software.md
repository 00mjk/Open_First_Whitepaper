## Open Source Software
### Terminology
Source code is the human readable version of software.  The code is written by developers and can be read and modify by others.  The code can be compiled into an executable or binary, that is not readable.

Free software and open source software is software where the source code is distributed and can be used, copied, studied and redistributed without restrictions.

Free software is the original name put forward by Richard Stallman and defended by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  Free software is defined by [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).  The freedom to run the program, study how it works, modify it and redistribute it.  Access to the source code is a precondition for these freedoms and not the end goal itself.

Open Source Software is the name used by the Open Source Initiative. They're the authority on certifying whether a software licence is an open source licence.  Open source software is defined in the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) by 10 criterias.

The two are almost equivalent but represent two different visions and neither want to be included in the other.  You will find authors using FOSS for "Free Open Source Software" or even FLOSS for "Free/Libre Open Source Software".  For the purposes of this whitepaper we opted to use "open source" to talk about free (in the sense of freedom) software and open source software.

### History
Free Software goes back to the beginnings of computer science.

### Development
OSS is how modern organizations build software. Documented advantages over software built by a handful of developers include the quality of solutions generated through the diversity of ideas and communities that form around a shared challenge. Exposing the problem space to other interested organizations also provides additional human capital to tackle challenges. For example, Linux, an open source operating system, is the largest development project in the world, with 1000s of people contributing to every release. Many competing companies contribute to Linux and other OSS, allowing them to leverage the work of a global community of OSS developers and shift developers from low-value work to high-value work.
