With a goal to determine the Government of Canada's preferred open source platforms, the following steps are being taken to ensure an open and collaborative process. 

**1. Design assessment criteria based on:**
 - Existing Government of Canada policies, standards, and guidelines
 - Open standards and best practices 
 - Domain-specific industry standards and best practices 
  
**2. Collaborative assessment against criteria:**
 - Leveraging open sourcs knowledge within the GC, domain experts will complete assessments 
 - Tools to be assessed against will be contributed by the community based on existing and emerging tools 
 - If you would like to assess a tool that you don't see listed, make a poll request for a new file, and use the [assessment template](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/Assessments/Template.md) 

**3. Consult with open source community:** 
 - Assessments will be shared through existing open source communities within and external to the GC 
 - Communities of practice are being established to help develop assessments, validate criteria, and consult with domain experts in a meaningful way. 
 - Consultations will be completed on-line and in-person 
 
 **4. GC Governance:**
  - Following the completion of the collaborative design process and consultations, recommendations for preferred open source platforms will be provided to the GC's Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB). 
  - If recommendation for preffered tool is approved by EARB, it will be added to the list of [Preferred Open Platforms](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/9_Preferred_Open_Platforms.md).
