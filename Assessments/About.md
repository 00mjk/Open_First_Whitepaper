With a goal to determine the Government of Canada's preferred open source platforms, the following steps are being taken to ensure an open and collaborative process. 

1. Design assessment criteria based on:

 - Existing Government of Canada policies, standards, and guidelines
 - Open standards and best practices 
 - Domain-specific industry standards and best practices 
  
2. Collaborative assessment against criteria:

 - Leveraging open sourcs knowledge within the GC, domain experts will complete assessments 
 - Tools to be assessed against will be contributed by the community based on existing and emerging tools 
 - If you would like to assess a tool that you don't see listed, make a poll request for a new file, and use the [assessment template](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/Assessments/Template.md)
