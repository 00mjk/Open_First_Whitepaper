## Introduction
This whitepaper captures the Government of Canada's (GC) approach to move towards a more open environment. While the GC has been operating in an open manner in some places, this will be our first attempt to bring all of these efforts together to more purposefully improve service delivery to the public. This includes changes in how we work, purchase, and provide information and services. Recognizing that as Canadians, and our partners become increasingly digital, the same must happen to our workforce. This whitepaper will outline the activities that support becoming more open in our digital society. 

This direction is coming from the top, supported by the Prime Minister, in October, 2017, the President of the Treasury Board (TB) signed a [Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) concerning Digital Government with the United Kingdom](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/memorandum-understanding-concerning-digital-government.html). This MOU outlines the need to work together to provide public services in an open manner based on the following [Digital 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_5), Principles: User Needs, Open Standards, Open Source Software, Open Markets, Open Government and Assisted Digital. 

Recognizing the GC's use of open source has continued to grow exponentially year after year (source?), there has been little done to update GC policies, governance, funding and processes to ensure that open source tools are being used at the right place at the right time, while ensuring they are supported in a sustainable way, and there is appropriate policy and guidance for employees using these tools when needed. This whitepaper will help us understand the GC current use of open tools, programs and activities as well as identify current gaps, and outline a path forward to create a more complete open environment. 

### Objectives
This whitepaper is being co-developed by members of the GC open source community in an effort to get the full-picture of open in the GC. Once we can better understand our use of open tools, programs and activities, we can find new ways to work, build and provide services. While we have made a first attempt at gathering research, including best practices and jurisdictional case studies, there are still gaps where community members can contribute. If you have something to add, we would encourage you to contribute your thoughts, expertise and references. 

We want to learn from Canadians, our partners, academics and technical experts to help us incorporate an open lens as we update GC policies, governance, funding and processes.

### GC Digital Principles (DRAFT)
Inspired by of the United Kingdom Government, the Government of Ontario and other jurisdictions, the GC has recentrly drafted digital principles that will guide how we work, interact with Canadians, and do business. 

1. #### Understand users and their needs
Start with user needs and build for them, and with them. Conduct ongoing testing with users. Do the hard work so that they don’t have to.

2. #### Iterate and improve frequently
Develop in an agile manner using alpha, beta and live phases. Test end-to-end and continuously improve in response to user feedback. Test early and often.

3. #### Build the right team
Create and empower multidisciplinary teams, linking policy with delivery.

4. #### Build a service-oriented culture
Lead and implement a team and departmental culture focused on users.

5. #### Work in the open
Share and collaborate in the open, plan to make data open from the start.

6. #### Integrate proportionate security and privacy from the outset 
Consider business context. Manage risks.

7. #### Build in an open and interoperable way
Give equal consideration for open source. Use open standards. Build in an interoperable and reusable way.

8. #### Use the right tools for the job
Use common government solutions and platforms. Build cloud first.

9. #### Design and deliver transparent and ethical services
Be open and transparent in the use of automated systems and comply with ethical guidelines.

10. #### Be inclusive and provide support for those who need it
Build in inclusiveness, official languages, and accessibility by design. 

11. #### Know your data
Manage data in line with standards. Implement analytical tools and use the data you collect.

12. #### Be accountable to Canadians
Define user-centred performance metrics. Publish real time data.

13. #### Develop open and innovative partnerships
Recognize that an organization can’t have all the best ideas. Create partnerships and collaborate.

14. #### Spend money wisely 
Enter into sensible contracts and comply with procurement standards. 

15. #### Test services with the Deputy Minister and/or Minister
Test all new public-facing services with the Deputy Minister and/or Minister responsible.

Three key principles that have guided this whitepaper are open culture, user needs, and interoperability. As you will learn, these concepts permeate all sections of this paper, therefore, we have expanded on this below.  

#### Acting Open
Being self aware of how we do our business is key. Conversations about how to break down silos between departments, our conversations with our partners, academia and the public continue to evolve. The use of open tools, practices, and involvement in open communities will help us to break through these silos and more directly connect people, ideas, tools, information, and services. 

#### User Needs
Gone are the days of designing a program, service, or tool without talking to the person who is going to be using it. Consultations, user experience testing, public opinion research are all important aspects of how we do business, and will continue to do business in the future. Once we incorporate the needs of our users, we can build servicea that help them with task they want to do more effectively and efficiently, and most importantly without having to understand government. This shift will require leaving behind many assumptions.  
#### Interoperability
Individuals, businesses, the public, institutions and things all communicate via computer exchanges. These computer exchanges have become an essential conduit, and their overall heterogeneity is an even greater reason for interoperability, meaning the ability to make a variety of information systems communicate with one another.  A lack of interoperability can lead, at best, to a breakdown in communication or operations and, at worst, to an outright loss of access to valuable information.

For any organization, especially public adminstrations, the need for interoperability is at two distinct yet overlapping levels: internal interoperability with its own IM-IT environment, and interoperability with the IM-IT environments of external stakeholders (other administrations, the public, businesses, associations), whether directly or indirectly, through the availability of open data.

##### External interoperability
The crux of the matter is not only technical, but also based on a set of concerns at various levels. The [European Interoperability Framework](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en) (EIF) defines these as:
- **Interoperability governance** refers to decisions on interoperability frameworks, institutional arrangements, organisational structures, roles and responsibilities, policies, agreements and other aspects of ensuring and monitoring interoperability at national and EU levels.
- **Legal interoperability** is about ensuring that organisations operating under different legal frameworks, policies and strategies are able to work together;
- **Organisational interoperability** refers to the way in which public administrations align their business processes, responsibilities and expectations to achieve commonly agreed and mutually beneficial goals;
- **Semantic interoperability** ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties, in other words ‘what is sent is what is understood’. In the EIF, semantic interoperability covers both semantic and syntactic aspects;
- **Technical interoperability** covers the applications and infrastructures linking systems and services. Aspects of technical interoperability include interface specifications, interconnection services, data integration services, data presentation and exchange, and secure communication protocols.

This the EIF definition of general interoperability:
>  Interoperability is the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems.

##### Internal interoperability
Internal interoperability is much more focused on the technical dimension. Particular attention should be paid to its definition, to ensure that it faithfully reflects expectations associated with the term, particularly in terms of independence - the term sovereignty is sometimes used - and neutrality.

A commonly used definition is the one proposed by the [Interoperability Working Group of the French speaking Libre Software Users' Association](http://interoperability-definition.info/en/):
>  Interoperability is a property of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, present or future, without any restricted access or implementation.

This definition is also a reminder of the vital link between interoperability and open standards. The specified interfaces undergo standardization and/or normalization processes to ensure the emergence and maintenance of common, documented references. This normalization work is done by specialized agencies that are usually either government agencies or organizations created by professionals from a given industry sector. These organizations include the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). In general, existing interoperability reference works recommend that administrations and their suppliers evaluate and use existing industrial standards in the same way as standards issued by national standardization bodies.

A major obstacle to interoperability arises from legacy systems. Historically, applications and information systems in public administrations were developed in a bottom-up fashion, trying to solve domain-specific and local problems. This resulted in fragmented IM-IT which are difficult to interoperate.

Due to the size of public administration and the fragmentation of IM-IT solutions, the plethora of legacy systems creates an additional interoperability barrier in the technical layer.

Technical interoperability should be ensured, whenever possible, via the use of open standards.

###### Independence and substitutability
From an internal perspective, interoperability is closely linked to the issue of enterprise architecture, in that it allows its various components to be decoupled while remaining integrated. Thus, the [Quebec government's common interoperability framework](http://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/ressources-informationnelles/architecture-dentreprise-gouvernementale/standards-et-normes/cadre-commun-dinteroperabilite/) (CCIGQ) is linked to the Cadre de référence de l'architecture d'entreprise gouvernementale (government enterprise architecture reference framework); and version 2 of France's [Référentiel général d'interopérabilité](http://references.modernisation.gouv.fr/interoperabilite) (General Guidelines for Interoperability) refers back to the [Cadre Commun d'Urbanisation du Système d'Information de l'État](http://references.modernisation.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Cadre%20Commun%20d%27Urbanisation%20du%20SI%20de%20l%27Etat%20v1.0_0.pdf) (common enterprise architecture framework for the State information system).

In the context of enterprise architecture fully under your control, one option to ensure the components' integration is standardization, either of the products directly or within a family of products generally offered by a single vendor. This approach can have functional advantages (generally in terms of a smooth integration between products), but it has the disadvantage of tying internal information technologies to an external system or a particular vendor. This connection can become both a technical handicap (by ruling out the possibility of adopting new, more relevant solutions) and an economic handicap (by decreasing opportunities to negotiate and by increasing switching costs). In an ideal interoperability scenario, however, the building blocks are substitutable: each one can be changed more easily and independently. This approach strengthens the freedom of choice and makes enterprise architecture more flexible, because each building block can be replaced by another with the same functionality without impacting the rest of the systems.

###### Application adherence - Vendor lock-in
Internally, interoperability can be viewed in two dimensions: the horizontal dimension (between two separate applications), which by nature is the dimension at play when two different systems interact; and the vertical dimension, which concerns the components of a single application. This is typically the case between the application itself and the underlying infrastructure components (for example, an application may require a specific database that, itself, works only on a particular operating system, without any functionalities coming into play). This is where application adherence factor in, falling outside the scope of interoperability but nevertheless sharing a number of fundamental principles with it.

###### Cloud computing
Cloud computing consists of providing infrastructure services and application services on demand. This is made possible through a high level of virtualization of hardware components by way of service infrastructure software. Cloud computing is based on a complex software architecture that simultaneously manages the elasticity of resources (processors, random access memory, storage and networks) and the ability of applications to make optimal use of these resources.

In terms of interoperability, there is no fundamental difference between a conventional infrastructure and a cloud, other than the complexity of the latter and the need to standardize vertical and horizontal components to a much greater degree. In particular, any outsourcing of infrastructure or applications to a public cloud must take into account the private or third-party organization's ability to apply standards that allow for the possibility of changing providers or reinstating a certain number of services, if necessary. In this context, the lack of an interoperability framework and open standards accepted by the provider poses a significant risk to the sustainability of the solution.

With respect to deploying a private cloud, interoperability promotes competition between providers, with respect to both hardware and software, as well as the ability to further develop the infrastructure over time. Indeed, the use of standards, through APIs for example, increases independence from the different drivers specific to the hardware components, and makes these infrastructure services independent from the software it deploys.

The implementation of a cloud is therefore a unique opportunity to standardize these processes and agree on a common framework. The use of an interoperability framework and the use of standards makes it easier and less costly to outsource part of the infrastructure of it to a third-party organization, or to migrate onto Shared Services Canada, in a hybrid solution.

##### Interoperability framework
An interoperability framework is defined as a set of policies, guidelines, standards, rules and recommendations made by a network of actors with a view to achieving the highest level of interoperability possible.

It also describes the operating rules that govern the analysis, selection, adoption and updating of each of these elements.

To ensure the deployment and longevity of interoperable systems, it is necessary to jointly select the standards to be adopted as well as the conditions for their implementation.

This is why several European countries (including France and the UK) and Canadian provinces such as Quebec have chosen to establish interoperability frameworks. The results are compelling, as open standards are regularly and widely used, and always the first approach to be considered when new requirements emerge.

As mentioned in the various interoperability frameworks that have already been published, they are designed only to identify key standards and not to offer predefined, unique solutions (for example, in terms of which software to choose). The objective of an interoperability framework is, therefore, to facilitate and guide an organization's interoperability choices while also limiting the number of potential standards in order to guarantee maximum clarity.
