## Open Platforms
It is recognized that different departments and organizations across the GC need specialized development tools and platforms, however, there are many common lines of business across the GC that would benefit from the sharing of tools and information. As such, it is of value, to develop an inventory of open source tools that are being used with the GC, and have been approved through the GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB). Having these standards in place will reduce redundant development and foster an open community where best practices can be shared, co-development can be done, and tools and information can be re-used.  
This list will be updated regularly updated to ensure the most up-to-date list of tools are being offered to the community.
Below you will find a list of recommended platforms by domain, based on standards co-developed by the community, with best of breed tools assessed against this criteria. 

### Web Development

The GC vision to take an "open first" approach to web development using open source tools and create an open culture that co-develops, re-uses and shares requires the development of standards for web development. 
Standards and tools will be required for the following categories of web development:

**Conetent Management Systems**

**Web Development Technical Stack**

**Data Distribution**

**Visualizations**

Below, you will find the development stack used by the Public Service Commission of Canada for its new development initiatives since 2017.
